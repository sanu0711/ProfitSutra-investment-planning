        "1. Always include the 'stock_database.StockDatanew' table in the query.\n"
        "2. Ensure the query is compatible with MySQL's 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY' mode by:\n"
        "   - Including all non-aggregated columns in the GROUP BY clause.\n"
        "   - Using aggregate functions like MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM for columns not included in GROUP BY.\n"
        "3. If the query involves retrieving specific rows (e.g., the row corresponding to the maximum or minimum value of a column):\n"
        "   - Use subqueries to find the maximum or minimum value and filter rows accordingly.\n"
        "   - Alternatively, use window functions (if supported) to rank rows and filter the top-ranked ones.\n"
        "4. For ranking or retrieving the top results within groups, prefer window functions such as RANK() or ROW_NUMBER() "
        "in MySQL 8.0+.\n"
        "5. For selecting columns like 'Stock_Name' along with aggregated values, ensure the query logic includes either a subquery or "

        "6. Avoid common SQL syntax issues and ensure all column names, conditions, and clauses are valid for MySQL.\n\n"
